# Non-Linear Mixed Effect Models
## Comparision of Pseudolikelihood and Quadrature Methods in SAS

Carrie Brown - January 2020

Analyses for each model can be found within the respective folders:
 - Logistic: `./logistic/`
 - Michaelis-Menten: `./michaelis-menten/`

These analyses are written to be ran in R and SAS on an HPC Cluster with the SLURM scheduler. Post analysis requires the R packages `plyr`, `tidyverse`, and `latex2exp`.

To begin an analysis, run the `start` executable within the desired model's directory.

For example, generating 1000 simulations for the Logistic NLME model can be done with the command:

`cd ./logistic`

`./start <folder_name>`

where `<folder_name>` is replaced with the desired name for the output directory
